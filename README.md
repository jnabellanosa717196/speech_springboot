## Problem
A politician will give many speeches in their political career. Many politicians currently draft their speeches in an ad-hoc fashion using Microsoft Word and share versions with their team using email. This process is inefficient as it does not allow for the users to centrally store, archive, and search their speeches.  This design is a portion of a system to automate this process. 
The system will have the capability for a politician to do the following:
1. View all their speeches saved in the system.
2. Add a speech to the system (a speech has the actual text, the author information, keywords about the speech and a speech date).
3. Edit a speech or its metadata.
4. Delete a speech.
5. The ability to search the speeches â€“ (search by author, date range, subject area, or snippets of text from the speech body).
